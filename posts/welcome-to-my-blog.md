# Welcome to My Blog!

Hey, I'm datallboy! I'm a sysadmin professionally, self taught full stack JS developer (which is how I built this site), and a new dad! Probably like most people who start a tech blog, I need a way to keep various notes and snippets organized. So what better way to keep notes than share them with others!

![Stack of Hats](https://res.cloudinary.com/dglc8g8js/image/upload/v1638985984/straw-hat-4472710_960_720_td4k1b.jpg)

I wear many hats in my career. Frequently I'll change field of study on a weekly basis, because I get bored studying the same topic for too long. Some days I'll setup a virtualized hypervisor lab. Others I'll dive into x86 assembly and reverse engineering random binaries.

At some point I will upload various notes on "Where to start in Cybersecurity" and others guides I share amoungst beginners. Most of what I share will be free resources, as I believe learning is a right and should be available to all who seek knowledge.

If you're just interested in chatting, come check out my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5kG6kp2zA8). It's full of IT professionals and hobbyists just hanging out and talking about tech.
